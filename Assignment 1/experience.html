<center><font color="white"><font face="times new roman"><font size="5">Before we conducted an event related to our course, we did a meetup at restaurant nearby. It was a great experience as my girl classmates and I walked together at rainy night just to do a simple meeting with our entire classmates. Throughout the meeting, we were able to communicate to each other and it was nice because everyone accepted each other's opinion just to ensure the upcoming event will be successful. </center>

<center><font color="white"><font face="times new roman"><font size="5">A day before the event, we did a final preparation until late night. It was tiring but we had so much fun. In the evening, my friends and I sent an invitation card to lecturers. Then, few preparation that we did was related to decoration such as making an origami, blow the balloons, patched the wallpaper, and many more. We are not hoping too much, but we truly wish the event gonna be successful.</center>

As an extrovert, it was no problem for me to became approachable. I handled the coupons session from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. After that, I continued my next duty at our booth by providing quizzes to students.</center>
